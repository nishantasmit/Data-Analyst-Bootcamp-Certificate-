# Data-Analyst-Bootcamp-Certificate-
I completed a comprehensive, self-paced Data Analytics Bootcamp on YouTube, which provided practical exposure to real-world data analysis techniques and tools. Throughout the bootcamp, I worked on multiple hands-on projects including:

MySQL Data Cleaning for structured data handling and preprocessing

Excel-based Data Cleaning for organizing and preparing raw datasets

Airbnb Data Analysis Project using Tableau for interactive dashboards and insights

Bike Sales Visualization Project using Microsoft Power BI for business intelligence reporting


Additionally, I gained proficiency in essential tools and technologies such as Pandas, Azure, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SQL, enabling end-to-end analysis workflows â€” from raw data cleaning to final visualization and storytelling.
